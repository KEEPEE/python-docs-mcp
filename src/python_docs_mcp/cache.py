"""SQLite-backed TTL key-value cache.

A tiny single-process cache used to persist fetched artifacts (the search
index, module docs, PyPI metadata and, since the politeness layer landed, the
HTTP validators + raw body of each cached page) between runs. Only stdlib
``sqlite3`` is used.

Design notes:
- One short-lived connection per operation, guarded by a re-entrant-free
  plain :class:`threading.Lock`, so concurrent calls from different threads
  of the same process cannot interleave writes. Connections are created and
  closed inside each call, so ``check_same_thread`` never becomes an issue.
- Expired rows are NOT deleted eagerly; :meth:`DocCache.get` simply ignores
  them and :meth:`DocCache.stats` reports how many there are.
- **Schema migration is additive, idempotent and runs once.** ``etag`` /
  ``last_modified`` / ``body`` were added to ``kv`` after the first release,
  when the politeness layer started reusing cached pages for conditional GET.
  :meth:`_ensure_schema` is called from :meth:`__init__` only (A13 B3 — it used
  to run on every connection) and issues ``ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`` only for
  columns that are actually missing, so a database written by the old schema
  keeps working untouched (existing rows get NULL, nothing is rewritten or
  dropped). Never ``DROP``/recreate here — real users have a warm cache. When
  the database cannot be opened at all, constructing :class:`DocCache`
  raises and the caller degrades to **no cache** (A13 B3).
- **A database that cannot be written is a supported state, not an error**
  (P5).  A root-owned ``cache.db``, a ``0444`` file or a directory without
  write permission makes the migration raise ``sqlite3.OperationalError``
  (``attempt to write a readonly database``).  The cache then runs in
  ``read_only`` mode: the migration is skipped, every later connection is
  opened through a ``file:…?mode=ro`` URI, reads keep working, and
  :meth:`DocCache.set` / :meth:`~DocCache.set_value` /
  :meth:`~DocCache.set_validators` are silent no-ops returning ``False`` —
  the cache is an optimisation, never a required dependency.  ``*_status()``
  reports ``read_only: true`` and that alone never changes ``overall``.
